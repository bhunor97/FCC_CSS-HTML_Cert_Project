        Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower (October 14, 1890 – March 28, 1969) was an
        American military officer and politician who served as the 34th
        president of the United States from 1953 to 1961.

          <li>
            As supreme commander of Allied forces in Western Europe during World
            War II, Dwight D. Eisenhower led the massive invasion of
            Nazi-occupied Europe that began on D-Day (June 6, 1944).
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1952, leading Republicans convinced Eisenhower (then in command
            of NATO forces in Europe) to run for president; he won a convincing
            victory over Democrat Adlai Stevenson and would serve two terms in
            the White House (1953-1961).
          </li>
          <li>
            During his presidency, Eisenhower managed Cold War-era tensions with
            the Soviet Union under the looming threat of nuclear weapons, ended
            the war in Korea in 1953 and authorized a number of covert
            anti-communist operations by the CIA around the world.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the home front, where America was enjoying a period of relative
            prosperity, Eisenhower strengthened Social Security, created the
            massive new Interstate Highway System and maneuvered behind the
            scenes to discredit the rabid anti-Communist Senator Joseph
            McCarthy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Though popular throughout his administration, he faltered in the
            protection of civil rights for African Americans by failing to fully
            enforce the Supreme Court’s mandate for the desegregation of schools
            in Brown v. Board of Education (1954).
          </li>
